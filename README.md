We have used the Xcore syntax, a concrete syntax for Ecore (https://wiki.eclipse.org/Xcore). In order to generate the GenModel and Ecore file from it, do as follows:

  - Right click -> New -> Other -> EMF Generator Model  
  - Write a Name for the generated (genmodel) file -> Next
  - XCore -> Load -> Select the root package -> Finish
  
You will have to install XCore Tools, OCL Tools, and Ecore Tools.
